## Amazing Works of Art ##

What was originally **A**ugmented **W**idgets **O**verlays **A**nimations (yah ... cheesy)

The concept is to start as a simple Gallery / Wallpaper website with a plan to evolve it into something more!
Based on Angular Quickstart using [Angular (4.1)](https://angular.io/) + [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) CDNs.
There may be some 'unnecessary' things included that may get used later.
